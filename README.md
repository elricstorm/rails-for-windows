What is Rails for Windows?
--------------------------------

Rails for Windows was created to help novice to intermediate Rails Developers integrate and develop applications 
on a Windows OS platform.  If you've searched and combed the web for resources pertaining to Windows/Ruby/Rails 
development then you've probably ascertained what many of us already know and realize:

    def information_related_to_windows
      puts ("bangs head on wall " * 1000)
    end
    
Information is either missing or scattered about in hard to reach places.  You may also begin to realize that 
linux and mac discussions start to overwhelm your searches on the web.  Even if you manage to find some resources 
that seem viable, the information may be outdated or unusable.  This leads many windows developers towards the path 
of absolute frustration.  The goal for this project is to provide you as much information as possible about Windows,
Ruby, Rails, virtual development, package management, and more.

### Why use Windows when...

    Linux has apt-get for package management
    
Windows has NuGet, Chocolatey, Boxstarter, and a host of other package management configurations.  Chocolatey is 
the equivallent of apt-get for windows. Boxstarter, coupled with chocolately, allows you to do remote installations, automate installs from 
the web, network shares, usb keys, or locally.  It even has reboot resiliency with administrative rights from 
start to finish. The NuGet software that helps us to achieve package management is also <i>open source</i>. 

    Linux has Linux Shell or Bash
    
Windows has PowerShell.  PowerShell uses cmdlets which allows windows developers to create complex scripting for 
managing windows systems.  It makes use of pipes, similar to Linux. However linux shells output text while PowerShell 
takes advantage of using objects with the *[pipeline] (http://www.howtogeek.com/138121/geek-school-learning-powershell-objects/)*.  It 
is also used with Chocolatey and package management.
