What is Rails for Windows?
--------------------------------

Rails for Windows was created to help novice to intermediate Rails Developers integrate and develop applications 
on a Windows OS platform.  If you've searched and combed the web for resources pertaining to Windows/Ruby/Rails 
development then you've probably ascertained what many of us already know and realize:

    def information_related_to_windows
      puts ("bangs head on wall " * 1000)
    end
    
Information is either missing or scattered in hard to reach places.
