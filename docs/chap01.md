## Chapter 01:  Understanding the Windows Environment

### Windows Environments

The main environments we will focus on are Windows 7 and Windows 8.  We'll also look into the difference 
between 32-bit and 64-bit OS and discuss potential impacts on developing and what changes you may need to make.

The following areas will become a part of the discussion tree:

* Structuring and Organizing your development areas
* Working with and setting up Environment Variables
* Working with and setting up the PowerShell environment  
* Handling Proxies
* Troubleshooting Issues

The main components we'll be working with in both windows environments will either be GUI related, or involve 
the use of command prompts (cmd) or PowerShell (ps).  

### Windows 8.1 (Blue)

For those of you unfamiliar to Windows 8.1 I recommend installing it for free!  Skip 
to **Chapter 03:  Virtualization** to find out how to get an environment up and running virtually in under 
15 minutes. If you already have an environment ready to go or you've completed the Virtualization chapter, 
continue on here.

#### Why use windows again?  Please remind me

Windows is one of the easiest operating environments to use from a feature, hardware, software, and support 
viewpoint.  One of the main reasons is that the [usage share] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems) 
is much greater with **any** windows environment than it is with Linux and Mac.  Even newly showcased 
Windows 8 has a much greater usage share than Linux and Mac (roughly 9.25% compared to Mac(7.73%) and Linux(1.61%)).  Windows 7 dominates at almost 47%!  Popularity breeds information and Windows also has better commercial support worldwide than any other environment.  As an fyi, I use (all) windows environments, Linux (centOS, Ubuntu), and MAC (Leopard).  This is not a discussion about whether or not Windows is better than the other environments.  That discussion is heavily opinionated and available all over the web.  

The main emphasis here is that everything you need to setup and use Ruby and Ruby on Rails is just as 
readily available for Windows as it is for any other operating environments.  You aren't going to install 
Ruby (the language) or Ruby on Rails (the framework) and then find out you can't use them.  You will also 
find that what you thought you knew about Windows as a development environment has changed by leaps and bounds.

Let's jump in together!  Hey, whoa.. hold on there.  Keep your shorts on.

#### Structuring and Organizing your Development Area

Before beginning any new development project it is important to determine the layout and structure of your 
working area.  If you are new to Ruby and Ruby on Rails it may be difficult to understand where to begin.  We 
can start with some simple basics relative to both Windows 7 and Windows 8.
