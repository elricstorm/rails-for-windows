## Chapter 02:  Getting Started

Before continuing you should make sure you have all of the tools necessary to continue with the tutorials and 
documentation.  All of the utilities for the tutorials are free to download and free to use.  $0 cost!  Here 
is a small list to get you started:

* *[.NET Framework 4.5] (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653)*
* PowerShell 2.0 or higher 
* Windows 7 or Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 (see **Chapter 03: Virtualization** for a free preview of Windows 8.1)
* *[7zip] (http://www.7-zip.org/download.html)*
* *[VirtualBox] (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)* (if you plan on installing a VM)

That should get you started initially.  If you plan on doing manual installations later on, you can look at 
the pre-requisites in **Chapter 05: Manual Installations**.  Otherwise, no other software is required.
